  <h1 id="heading1">My Trip from Ho Chi Minh to Ha Tinh</h1>

  <div class="informations">
    <h2 id="heading2">Introduction</h2>
    <p id="info1">
      Hello guys! It's me, Tan Dat.<br>
      You probably remember me ‚Äî the guy who overthinks the most in class, right? Yeah yeah, I know (pretty embarrassing actually üòÖ).<br>
      Anyway, just like the title says‚Ä¶ yup, you heard that right! I traveled from Ho Chi Minh City to my hometown, Ha Tinh. Pretty cool, right?
    </p>

    <h2 id="heading3">Why did you go there?</h2>
    <p id="info2">
      Honestly‚Ä¶ I didn't even really know at first (since my mum was the one to bring me here in the first place üòê) ‚Äî but to be fair, living here has been really, REALLY fun!
    </p>

    <h2 id="heading4">Before the journey starts...</h2>
    <p>
      <div id="info3">
      I went to Ha Tinh with my mom. We waited at the international airport for my siblings.<br>
      We booked a flight to Vinh and waited. My little brother was hungry and asked his mom for a sandwich. She said no, but our aunt gave him some money. He bought two of them and shared it with me.<br>
      On the plane, I took a beautiful photo ‚Äî look at the clouds!<br>
      After landing in Vinh, we took a family van to my grandmother's hometown.

    </p>

    <h2 id="heading5">What activities did you do there?</h2>
    <p id="info4">
      We spent most of our time in the countryside just relaxing and playing games.<br>
      My little brother and I played football a lot ‚Äî he usually wins because he's been learning how to play and has more experience than me! (Well‚Ä¶ he is also in a football club, so that helps too üòÖ).<br>
      We also helped take care of our mom's younger brothers.<br>
      There was one emotional moment when we held the final ceremony for our grandfather at the funeral. It was quiet and meaningful.<br>
      Best of all, we stayed at my auntie's house!<br>
      We had late-night game sessions filled with snacks, laughter, and fun.<br>
      Oh! And btw ‚Äî here are a few pictures of the view from my countryside!<br>
    </p>

    <h2 id="heading6">How did you feel, and what did you miss during this trip?</h2>
    <p id="info5">
      Being in my hometown has been a mix of fun and boring moments. We played games, ate snacks, and enjoyed the quiet countryside. Though‚Ä¶ I was a bit scared of the downstairs bathroom since it doesn't flush XD (but at least the upstairs one works!).<br>
      We also did a final ceremony for my kind grandfather who passed away. I didn't have many memories with him, but I'll always remember him in my heart.<br>
      I did miss the end-of-year ceremony at school. Seeing my friends in the award photos made me a little sad ‚Äî I wanted to be in one too...
    </p>

    <h2 id="heading7">Last question: Why did you make this blog anyway?</h2>
    <p id="info6">
      I created this blog to turn all those feelings into something meaningful ‚Äî not just as a memory for myself, but also for my classmates, even those who might transfer schools or move abroad. It's a small gift to leave behind a piece of who I am ‚Äî the quiet (well, not always üòÖ), thoughtful kid in class who just wanted to share a story.
    </p>

    <p id="info7"><br>
      And before I end this blog, I just wanna say that... Thank you... Everyone, including our teacher, <b>Ms. Ha Giang</b>, if you ever see this blog page for reading this, I spent like around 3 days on this small little project that I've made during this summer! Hope that everyone is always happy and has an awesome summer!<br><br>
      Thank you... Everyone for reading this amazing blog<br>
